Microart.cf's Prisma Schema
===========================

microart.cf uses MongoDB under the hood in order to serve 
dynamic content. This Prisma schema file is part of our 
transition from "static" API endpoints to dyanmic data-
fetching via Prisma schema's. This repository simply hosts
the schema file for development and testing use. Note: 
This is the same file that is deployed to the web server
server as well.
